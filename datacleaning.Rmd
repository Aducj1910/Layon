## Data Cleaning

The code below reads in the CSV of the WARN database that can be found at https://layoffdata.com/data/.

```{r}
layoff = read_csv('data/warn.csv')
```


```{r}

layoff_refined = layoff %>%
  rename(state = "State", company = "Company", city = "City", laidoff = "Number of Workers", warn_date = "WARN Received Date", eff_date = "Effective Date", layoff_type = "Closure/Layoff") %>%
  select(state, laidoff) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(total_laidoff = sum(!is.na(laidoff)))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
