##   when the tidyverse library is loaded, messages are generated that we do not want to include in the knitted document
## setting the chunk argument include = FALSE means this chunk is executed, but the text in the chunk and any output do not appear in the knitted document
## Hash tags allow you to comment-out the code; you can use multiple depending on your preference but only one is needed.
## Any characters after a hash tag on a line are comments.
## 'knitr' is the package that turns R Markdown into a document
## The following command sets some options for this R Markdown file
##   echo = TRUE means that the code in R chunks will appear the knitted document
##   message = FALSE and warning = FALSE mean that messages and warnings do not appear in the final document
##   error = TRUE means the document will continue to knit in the presence of errors while knitting

## The `library()' function loads in a package; the package must already be installed.
## `tidyverse' is the name of a collection of more than a dozen packages designed to work with each other.
## The library(tidyverse) command loads eight core packages, including ggplot2
## Others we often use, such as lubridate, need to be loaded separately
## The 'lubridate' package has useful functions for dates.

## `mendota` is a new object.
## The `=` assigns the loaded data set to the object name `mendota`.
## You will often see `<-' instead as the assignment operator.
##   I use `=` almost all the time, but `<-` is more common.
## read_csv() is a function in the tidyverse for reading in .csv files.
## There is a base R function named read.csv(). Use read_csv() instead.
## If you use read.csv(), character variables get changed to factors
##   and variable names might get changed.
## The argument to read_csv() is a path to the file with the data
## The '..' means go up a directory
## Use a '/' after a directory
## The result of the code below is to create a data frame named mendota
##   by reading in the data in the file.
### COURSE/data/ contains the data file
### COURSE/lectures/unit2-ggplot2/ is your working directory
